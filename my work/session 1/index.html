        <p style="background-color: rgb(252, 252, 252);">Georgia has seen widespread protests over the past few days following the governmentâ€™s decision to suspend talks on joining the European Union for four years. Thousands of demonstrators have taken to the streets in Tbilisi and other cities, accusing the ruling Georgian Dream party of pursuing pro-Russian and anti-Western policies. Protesters are calling for new elections, citing alleged irregularities in recent polls, and are clashing with police who have used water cannons and tear gas to disperse crowds.</p>

    <p>The demonstrations reflect growing frustration with what many see as a government moving away from the pro-European aspirations of most Georgians. The crisis has drawn international condemnation, with the U.S. and EU criticizing excessive police force and suspending partnerships with Georgia in response to the escalating tension. </p>
